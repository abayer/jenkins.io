email, hip chat, slack, IRC

The notifications section of a pipeline defines both where to send a notification, and on what event:

----
    notifications {
        always {
            echo "I HAVE FINISHED"
        }
        success {
            echo "MOST DEFINITELY FINISHED"
        }
        failure {
            echo "I FAILED"
        }
        changed {
            echo "Things were different before..."
        }
    }
----

As notifications are steps, making use of Jenkins plugins to send them is doable. In this example, using email:

----
    notifications {
        success {
            mail to:"abayer@cloudbees.com", subject:"SUCCESS: ${currentBuild.rawBuild.fullDisplayName}", body: "Yay, we passed."
        }
        failure {
            mail to:"abayer@cloudbees.com", subject:"FAILURE: ${currentBuild.rawBuild.fullDisplayName}", body: "Boo, we failed."
        }
        unstable {
            mail to:"abayer@cloudbees.com", subject:"UNSTABLE: ${currentBuild.rawBuild.fullDisplayName}", body: "Huh, we're unstable."
        }
        changed {
            mail to:"abayer@cloudbees.com", subject:"CHANGED: ${currentBuild.rawBuild.fullDisplayName}", body: "Wow, our status changed!"
        }
    }
----

There is also Hipchat, Slack, IRC and more (even Yo has a notifier).

(Seriously: https://github.com/jenkinsci/notify-yo-plugin - it won't work in current form with pipeline, however, and I am not even sure if Yo still exists as an app).
